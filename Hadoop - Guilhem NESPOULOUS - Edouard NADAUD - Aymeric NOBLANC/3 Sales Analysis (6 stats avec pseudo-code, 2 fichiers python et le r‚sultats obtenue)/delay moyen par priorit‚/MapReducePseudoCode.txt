- map

Input: key = LongWritable, value = Text

Output: key = Text, value = IntWritable

* get the priority ( 5ème column)
* calcul the delay between the order date and the ship date (8ème column - 6ème column)
* for each row, add an output key/value pair of <priority, delay>

- reduce

Input: key = Text, value = IntWritable

Output: key = Text, value = IntWritable

* calculate the sum for each of the delay associated with the priority
* add an output key/value pair of <priority, ave_delay>
